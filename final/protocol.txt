Packet Specification
====================

All packets consist of a command and parameters. The command and parameters are separated by a space, and parameters are delimited by spaces. Unless otherwise noted, all parameters are signed integers. Each packet is terminated with a newline (0xA) character to facilitate parsing.

Connections are done using plaintext TCP sockets with a standard port of 5005. The server is specifically designed to support only one simultaneous client to prevent desynchronization issues.


Client to Server
----------------

Set target location of the robot. Tiles are integer coordinates within -50 to 50.

moveto <tile x> <tile y>
- ex. moveto 4 3


Play a song (with id string) to indicate which food item to dispense to the robot. Standard options are "demo1" and "ffwin".

food <song id>
- ex. food demo1



Server to Client
----------------

Update robot position. Coordinates are measured in rotary encoder ticks. There are 1200 ticks per tile.

pos <x> <y>
- ex. pos 400 -300


Notify the client that an obstacle has been encountered.

block <tile x> <tile y>
- ex. block 5 7


Send the current path to the client (list of pairs of coordinates). This is sent every time a new obstacle is encountered (i.e. each time a new path is generated)

path [<tile x> <tile y>]
- ex. path 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 5
